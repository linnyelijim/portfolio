                                <p>Make sure to bring plenty of water, snacks, and various
                                    clothing layers based on the weather and terrain.

                                <p>You should base your attire on your local weather conditions
                                    and the type of hike you choose. Generally, bring warm and 
                                    waterproof layers, a good set of hiking shoes that are 
                                    broken in, and something to protect you from the sun.

                            <button class="accordion">What about bears?</button>
                            <div class="panel">
                                <p>If you're worried about bears, you can make some sort 
                                    of noise constantly to make them aware of your presence. 
                                    If you come upon one on a trail, back away slowly and do 
                                    not engage. If the situation gets bad, use bear spray. 
                                </p>

                            <div class="panel">
                                <p>Bear spray is similar to extra strong mace and is used to 
                                    momentarily incapacitate a bear or other large animal in 
                                    a life and death situation. It should not be used lightly 
                                    and is very irritating to human eyes and skin, so use with
                                    care. Never spray yourself or children. Not similar to bug
                                    spray. Avoid skin and eyes.
                                </p>

                                <p>That can depend on the time of year, as well as what type
                                    of terrain you plan to hike in. If you're near water or in
                                    completely wooded areas, there is a high likelihood you 
                                    will encounter bugs. A general rule of thumb is that it's
                                    better to have bug repellent and not need it, then need it 
                                    and not have it.
